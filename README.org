** Public apps can't send client secret

Seems we should NOT be sending client secret for this public app: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38786249/error-public-clients-cant-send-a-client-secret-while-try-to-get-access-token-i

** userAudience / signinAudience

#+begin_example
Error invalid_request: The request is not valid for the application's 'userAudience' configuration. In order to use /common/ endpoint, the application must not be configured with 'Consumer' as the user audience. The userAudience should be configured with 'All' to use /common/ endpoint.
#+end_example

To fix this, edit manifest (see screenshot) and change:

#+begin_src json
  "signInAudience": "AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount",
#+end_src
